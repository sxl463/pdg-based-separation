This work demonstrates the use of SVG images in LaTeX documents.
Using the PDF + LaTeX output option of Inkscape 0.48, it is possible
to include SVG images in LaTeX and have LaTeX typeset the text. This
results in the same text style in the images as in the text. Moreover,
LaTeX commands can be used in the image's text, such as math or
references.
The document also describes how to automate the conversion from SVG to
PDF+LaTeX using Inkscape.
