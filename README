0. Welcome to Shen's course project code repo!

   If you have any problems please send an email to sxl463@psu.edu

   Notice there is a pdf document inside this repo

   "An brief introduction to PDG implementation.pdf"
   
1. What is this repo about?

   This directory lists all the code related to my course project and now you

   can use this project to generate a Program dependence graph for taint analysis.

   The test files are in ./test (obsolete).


2. How to build

   llvm/clang/compiler-rt toolchain needs to be pre-installed, please go to 

   the following website and install llvm 3.5.0 first:

   http://llvm.org/releases/3.5.0/docs/GettingStarted.html 

   and then, input "make" directly, if you can see a pdg.so in repo, that

   means you build the project succcessfully.


3. How to test?

   Use the testing file strato.bc under ./test as an example

   cd test

   clang --emit-llvm -c strato.c -o strato.bc

   cd ..

   ./run_pdg_pass.sh ./test/strato.bc

   and go to ./visualization/, the PDG graph can be visualized as pdg.png

   (i put a generated png file there already)


   Thanks for using my program!
